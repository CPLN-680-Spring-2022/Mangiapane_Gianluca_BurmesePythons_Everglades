            <abstract>This dataset shows FWC-designated bird sanctuaries occurring throughout Florida. The boundaries of each sanctuary were digitized from a variety of sources including historical documents such as FWC establishment orders and parcel plat maps. To ensure accuracy of the digitization process for each bird sanctuary, reference datasets and documents were compiled and divided into three regions: North, East, and West. All reference data was then re-projected to NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_East_FIPS_0901_Ft_US, NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_West_FIPS_0902_Ft_US, or NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_North_FIPS_0903_Ft_US, respectively. These regions and projections were chosen to match the use of US feet in the legal descriptions of each bird sanctuary and any accompanying plat/parcel surveys. After all reference data was prepared, an individual bird sanctuary dataset for each region was created in the appropriate projection. The legal descriptions establishing the bird sanctuaries varied widely in terms of detail. If specific plat books or plat maps were referenced in the legal description, staff used these documents in combination with the available countywide parcels dataset and World Street Map to digitize the sanctuaries. All three bird sanctuary datasets were then merged into one dataset, and this final statewide dataset was reprojected to NAD_1983_2011_Florida_FGDL_Albers. Please see the sources section for more information regarding the reference datasets and legal descriptions.</abstract>
            <purpose>This dataset was developed to map the areas designated as bird sanctuaries by FWC throughout Florida.</purpose>

        <logic>These data appear to be logically consistent. A geodatabase topology was run to detect and remove any overlapping polygons. With the exceptions of the Choee Howletee Bird Sanctuary (occurring within the South Dade Restricted Hunting Area) and the southernmost portion of the Anastasia Island Bird Sanctuary (occurring within the St. Augustine Beach Bird Sanctuary), no overlapping polygons are present.</logic>
        <complete>These data are complete as of data available to FWRI in July of 2019.</complete>

            <procstep>
                <procdesc>To ensure accuracy of the digitization process for each bird sanctuary, reference datasets and documents were compiled and divided into three regions: North, East, and West. These regions correspond to the Florida Department of Transportation’s State Plane Zones 901 East, 902 West, and 903 North (please see the August 2017 FDOT Districts State Plane &amp; UTM Zones PDF map available here: http://fdot.gov/geospatial/maps/zones_districts.pdf. All reference data was then re-projected to NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_East_FIPS_0901_Ft_US, NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_West_FIPS_0902_Ft_US, or NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_North_FIPS_0903_Ft_US, respectively. These regions and projections were chosen to match the use of US feet in the legal descriptions of each bird sanctuary and any accompanying plat/parcel surveys. Individual parcel boundary datasets for each county were also re-projected into NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_West_FIPS_0902_Ft_US, NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_East_FIPS_0901_Ft_US, or NAD_1983_2011_StatePlane_Florida_North_FIPS_0903_Ft_US, depending upon which State Plane Zone the county was included in. After all reference data was prepared, an individual bird sanctuary dataset for each region was created in the appropriate projection. The legal descriptions establishing the bird sanctuaries varied widely in terms of detail. If specific plat books or plat maps were referenced in the legal description, staff used these documents in combination with the available countywide parcels dataset and World Street Map to digitize the bird sanctuary at a scale of 1:5,000. Where bird sanctuaries included portions of shoreline, digitization occurred at a scale of 1:12,000. For sanctuaries with a more general description, digitization occurred at a scale of 1:24,000. Where specific bearings and distances were provided in the legal description, staff used either the Direction and Length heads-up editing tools or the Coordinate Geometry (COGO) toolbar (with Ground to Grid Correction applied as necessary) to digitize the final boundaries of the sanctuary. Where the use of the Direction/Length or COGO tools resulted in a feature that closely matched the available parcel boundaries, the parcel boundaries were used for the final boundary instead. After all bird sanctuaries for a region were digitized and reviewed against the legal description, a topology was run to detect and remove any overlapping polygons. Exceptions were made for the Choee Howletee bird sanctuary (occurring within the South Dade Restricted Hunting Area) and the southernmost portion of the Anastasia Island Bird Sanctuary (occurring within the St. Augustine Beach Bird Sanctuary). All three bird sanctuary datasets were then merged into one dataset, and this final statewide dataset was re-projected to NAD_1983_2011_Florida_FGDL_Albers.</procdesc>

                <procdesc>Added Casselberry Restricted Hunting Area (RHA 19-01). Since the legal description in the Establishment Order and Memorandum of Understanding matched the Casselberry City Limits, staff downloaded the updated City Limits polygon dataset from the Seminole County GIS department's open data site and selected for those polygons representing the jurisdictional limits of the City of Casselberry, Florida. These polygons were exported to a new dataset and the dataset reprojected to NAD_1983_2011_FGDL_Albers. Staff then removed those polygons intersecting Lake Howell before merging with the main statewide dataset.</procdesc>
